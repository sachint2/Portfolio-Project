#COVID-19 Data Analysis Project Summary
Introduction:
As a personal project, I explored COVID-19 data using SQL and Tableau to gain insights into the global pandemic's trends and patterns. Leveraging my data extraction, cleaning, and visualization skills, I aimed to comprehensively analyze the COVID-19 situation.

Data Extraction and Cleaning:
Utilizing SQL, I extracted COVID-19 data from the World Health Organization (WHO) database. This involved rigorous cleaning processes to ensure data integrity, including handling missing values and standardizing data formats. By employing SQL methodologies such as joins, temporary tables, aggregate functions, and views, I organized the data for in-depth analysis.

Analysis with SQL:
With the clean and organized dataset, I employed SQL to thoroughly analyze global confirmed COVID-19 death data. By leveraging SQL functionalities, I explored trends, patterns, and correlations within the data, providing valuable insights into the progression of the pandemic.

Visualization with Tableau:
To facilitate intuitive exploration and interpretation of the COVID-19 data, I utilized Tableau to create dynamic visualizations and interactive dashboards. These visualizations allowed for a holistic view of COVID-19 trends, enabling stakeholders to comprehend complex data patterns easily.

Conclusion:
Through the integration of SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, I successfully conducted a comprehensive examination of COVID-19 data. This project not only enhanced my skills in SQL and Tableau but also provided valuable insights into the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
