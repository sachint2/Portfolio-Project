Projects

1. Nashville Housing Data Transformation

• Leveraging SQL, I cleaned, transformed, and aggregated housing data sourced from GitHub, analyzing property trends in Nashville. My work included data validation, aggregating data, performing complex joins, and creating temporary tables and views to produce reports highlighting the most valuable market insights.

2. COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

• With a combination of SQL and Tableau, I analyzed global COVID-19 data, creating interactive dashboards to visualize infection, death, and vaccination trends by country. Using CTEs, temporary tables, and advanced SQL queries, I derived meaningful insights such as infection and death rates, highlighting regions with the highest impact. The Tableau dashboards presented complex data patterns in an intuitive format, allowing stakeholders to gain actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

3. Automation Workflow - Goldman Sachs

• At Goldman Sachs, I designed and implemented an Alteryx automation workflow to streamline data management within the client portal. By integrating backend data and comparing it with Microsoft Access databases, I improved data accuracy by 80% and reduced manual verification processes, saving considerable time and optimizing operational efficiency.

4. COVID-19 Data Visualization - Tableau

• I developed a series of visualizations using Tableau that enabled stakeholders to explore and interpret COVID-19 data patterns interactively. This project enhanced stakeholders' ability to understand data trends, such as the impact of various infection spikes, vaccine rollouts, and recovery rates, ultimately supporting pandemic response strategies.

5. Movie Data Analysis

• Utilizing Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I performed data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization on a dataset of movies. Through scatter plots, regression models, and correlation heatmaps, I investigated relationships between budget, gross earnings, and release years, providing insights on factors influencing movie revenue.

I’m constantly learning and expanding my skill set to tackle new challenges in data analysis and business systems.
