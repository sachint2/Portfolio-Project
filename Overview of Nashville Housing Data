Q&A Insights for Nashville Housing Data 

1: What format was the SaleDate field initially in, and how did we convert it?
The SaleDate field initially had a non-standard date format. We converted it to a standardized DATE format 
using the CONVERT function and stored it in a new column, SaleDateConverted. This allows for consistent and 
reliable date comparisons in future analyses.
2: How did we handle missing values in the PropertyAddress column?
By joining records with the same ParcelID, we filled in missing addresses where possible. Using an ISNULL function
allowed us to substitute missing PropertyAddress entries with known addresses from matching ParcelID records. This 
ensures all properties have address data.

3: Why did we separate PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress into individual fields?
Splitting addresses into Address, City, and State components enhances data granularity and usability. 
This breakdown supports more detailed location-based analysis, such as city-specific trends or address-based filtering.

4:What was the purpose of replacing Y and N values in the SoldAsVacant column?
We standardized the SoldAsVacant field by changing Y and N values to Yes and No. This makes the data more intuitive
and human-readable, particularly for non-technical users.

5:How did we identify and remove duplicate records?
A Common Table Expression (CTE) with the ROW_NUMBER() function helped us find duplicate entries by parcelID, 
PropertyAddress, SalePrice, SaleDate, and LegalReference. We retained only the first occurrence of each duplicate, ensuring unique records within the dataset.

6: Why were certain columns dropped from the final dataset?
After completing all necessary transformations, we dropped redundant columns (OwnerAddress, TaxDistrict, PropertyAddress, and SaleDate) to reduce clutter. 
These columns were either transformed or contained data now represented in other fields, making them unnecessary for analysis.
